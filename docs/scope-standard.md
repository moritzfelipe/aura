Here’s the tight recap of everything we covered—what you want to build, the main debates, where we landed, and open choices.

# Vision / scope

* **Goal:** a tiny **standard** (not a product) for open publishing that reuses **existing, widely adopted standards** instead of inventing new ones.
* **Core idea:** combine **ERC-721** (for posts) with **RSS/Atom** (for consumption) so anyone can publish, discover by address, and read via normal feed tooling.
* **Initial focus:** bot-first / AI-generated **news-style** posts; humans can use it too.
* **Storage:** **content off-chain** (IPFS/Arweave/gateway). On-chain only references/ids. Optionally include a **content hash** in metadata for integrity.

# Your constraints / preferences

* Keep the **base layer minimal**; leave indexing, curation, ranking, and moderation to implementers.
* Avoid custom protocols/routers where possible; **standards-only** is the guiding principle.
* **Gas cost is acceptable** on L2s—even per post—especially for bots; cost can also act as light spam friction.
* You want **each post to be individually tippable**, with tips acting as “**likes with money**” (a strong ranking signal).

# Key debates and resolutions

**A. 721-per-post vs event-only**

* I argued events are leaner for feeds (indexing, edits/deletes, state bloat).
* You prefer 721 because it’s **most widely adopted** and keeps the spec familiar.
* **Where we landed:** it’s reasonable to make **each post an ERC-721**, *provided* we pair it with a way to give the post a **payable address**.

**B. “An address per post”**

* Important correction: an ERC-721 **token itself is not an address**.
* **Resolution:** use **ERC-6551 (token-bound accounts)** so **each post (721)** has a **deterministic on-chain account address**. That address can receive ETH/ERC-20 tips directly—no custom router required.

**C. Identity and referencing**

* **Publisher identity:** use **CAIP-10** (chain-scoped account id).
* **Post id:** use **CAIP-19** for the NFT (chain + contract + tokenId). This gives everyone a canonical, chain-agnostic reference string.
* **Feeds:** expose posts to the web via **Atom/RSS** generated from your off-chain payloads (clean mapping; no need to embed XML inside token metadata).

**D. Tipping as the core engagement**

* Every post’s **6551 account** is the tip target.
* For smooth wallet UX, publish **EIP-681 payment links** (ETH and popular ERC-20).
* Optional analytics: indexers rank posts by on-chain tips (amount, token, recency, payer uniqueness). No centralized “likes.”

# Practicalities / costs (6551)

* **Deployment cost:** a small proxy per post (cheap on L2s). Make a policy choice:

  * **Pre-deploy** accounts when you mint (safe for QR/raw addresses), or
  * **Lazy-deploy** on first tip (cheaper if many posts never get tips; avoid showing raw addresses until deployed).
* **Per-tip cost:** close to normal transfers; ERC-20 cost dominated by token transfer itself.
* **Forward vs sweep:** either auto-forward tips to the creator (slightly higher per-tip gas) or let funds accumulate in the post account and **sweep** occasionally (cheaper overall).

# Minimal spec sketch (what we loosely agreed is “in”)

* **MUST**

  * Post is **ERC-721**; canonical id = **CAIP-19**.
  * Content lives **off-chain** (IPFS/etc.); include a **content hash** for integrity.
  * Publisher identity expressible as **CAIP-10**.
* **SHOULD**

  * Each post has a **deployed ERC-6551 account address** (payable).
  * Provide **EIP-681** payment URIs for tipping.
  * Provide a simple **JSON payload → Atom/RSS** mapping so readers/aggregators can consume feeds easily.
* **MAY**

  * Make posts **non-transferable** if you don’t want trading.
  * Expose optional **edit/delete signals** (e.g., “Replaced”/“Tombstoned”) for indexers to respect.
  * Offer **collects** as ERC-1155 editions (optional, separate from the base).

# What stays out of the base standard (by your choice)

* No mandated **indexer**, ranking, moderation, or spam policy.
* No custom **tipping router**—plain transfers to the post’s 6551 account are sufficient.
* No prescribed marketplaces or UI; implementers are free to build.

# Open decisions you can keep flexible

* Whether to **lock transfers** on the 721 (policy).
* Whether to **require** edit/delete signals or keep them as a recommendation.
* Pre-deploy vs **lazy-deploy** 6551 accounts.
* Whether to publish both **Atom and RSS 2.0**, or just Atom as canonical.

## One-sentence bottom line

We converged on a **standards-only, minimal spec** where **each post is an ERC-721** with a **token-bound (ERC-6551) account** for **per-post tipping**, content lives off-chain, identities are **CAIP-10/19**, and the web surface is **Atom/RSS**—with everything else (indexing, ranking, moderation) left to implementers.
