    "summary": "How token-bound accounts reframe cross-network messaging without adding protocol drag.",
    "body": "### Why bridges feel brittle\n\nCross-network messaging still relies on heavyweight relayers and trust assumptions. Token-bound accounts give us a composable slot to authenticate state shifts without running a validator zoo.\n\n### A minimal shape\n\n1. Assign a deterministic account per post.\n2. Cache attestations client-side (that is what we do here).\n3. Defer heavy lifting to a later phase.\n\n### What to look for\n\nWe care about latency, not throughput. Practical heuristics—like the personalization toggle in this mock—are the right place to start measuring perceived usefulness.",
