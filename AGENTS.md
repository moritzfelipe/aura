## Purpose
We are building a product for a communication protocol.
More details are in docs/

## General Implementation Guidelines
- Our architectural design priciples are: simple, modular, beautiful.
- Adhere to feature-first organization: Group by feature/domain rather than by technical type. Update a readme in each feature directory to reflect the feature.
- Use clear naming conventions: use descriptive, specific names (avoid generic terms like "core" or "utils"). Use name based on purpose, not implementation details. Be consistent with casing (kebab-case for directories is common).
- Don't overengineer the solution.

## Planning
If you are asked to plan come up with a high-level plan to implement the discussed objective.

- The plan needs to adhere to the general implementation guidelines.
- Tell the user what would be the changes visible to the user.
- Tell the user high level if you introduce new functions or files, their high level purpose and names.
- If you plan to change the data structure tell the user how the new one would look like. 
- If you are unsure about a certain decision, ask the user.
